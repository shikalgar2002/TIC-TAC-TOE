# TIC-TAC-TOE
 Tic-Tac-Toe is a  game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row first is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
